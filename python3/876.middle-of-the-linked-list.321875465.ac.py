# Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,4,5]'
#
# Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle
# node of linked list.
# 
# If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
# The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is
# [3,4,5]).
# Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
# ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next
# = NULL.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: Node 4 from this list (Serialization: [4,5,6])
# Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second
# one.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the given list will be between 1 and 100.

# Definition for singly-linked list.

#     def __init__(self, x):

class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return head
        tort = head
        hare = head.next
        while hare:
            tort = tort.next
            if hare.next:
                hare = hare.next.next
            else:
                hare = None

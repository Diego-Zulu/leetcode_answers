#
# A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random
# pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
# 
# Return a deep copy of the list.
# 
# The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each
# node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:
# 
# 
# val: an integer representing Node.val
# random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random
# pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
# Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
# Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
# Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: head = []
# Output: []
# Explanation: Given linked list is empty (null pointer), so return null.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# -10000 <= Node.val <= 10000
# Node.random is null or pointing to a node in the linked list.
# Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.
#

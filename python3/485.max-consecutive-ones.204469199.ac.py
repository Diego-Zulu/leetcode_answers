# Testcase Example:  '[1,0,1,1,0,1]'
#
# Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this
# array.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive
# 1s.
# ‚Å†   The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
# The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

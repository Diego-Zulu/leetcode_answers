#
# You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the
# shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You
# are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:
# 
# 
# Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
# Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
# Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.
# 
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [[1,0,2,0,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0]]
# 
# 1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
# |   |   |   |   |
# 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
# |   |   |   |   |
# 0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
# 
# Output: 7 
# 
# Explanation: Given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at
# (0,2),
# ‚Å†            the point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the
# total 
# travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.
# 
# Note:
# There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such
# house according to the above rules, return -1.

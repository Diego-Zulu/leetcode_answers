#
# Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. The new list
# should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
# 
# Example:
# 
# Input: 1->2->4, 1->3->4
# Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        merged_head = ListNode(-1)
        merged = merged_head
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                merged.next = l1
                l1 = l1.next
            else:
                merged.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            merged = merged.next
        for l in (l1, l2):
            while l:
                merged.next = l
                l, merged = l.next, merged.next
        return merged_head.next

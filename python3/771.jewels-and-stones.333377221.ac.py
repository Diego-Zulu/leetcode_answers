#
# You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and
# S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone
# you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
# 
# The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are
# letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of
# stone from "A".
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
# Output: 3
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
# Output: 0
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
# The characters in J are distinct.

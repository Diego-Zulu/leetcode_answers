#
# Given a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of list and return its
# head.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
# 
# After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes
# 1->2->3->5.
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# Given n will always be valid.
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# Could you do this in one pass?

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next = head
        slow = dummy
        fast = head
        for _ in range(n):
            fast = fast.next
        while fast is not None:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        slow.next = slow.next.next
        return dummy.next

# Testcase Example:  '[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]\n0'
#
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown
# to you beforehand.
# 
# (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
# 
# You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its
# index, otherwise return -1.
# 
# You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
# 
# Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: 4
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: -1
#

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums)-1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + int((right - left) / 2)
            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif target <= nums[right] and nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid+1
            elif target >= nums[left] and nums[mid] < nums[left]:
                right = mid-1
            elif target > nums[mid]:
                left = mid+1
            else:
                right = mid-1
        return -1
